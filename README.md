# QiEA: Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm
**QiEA** is a Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm for Service-matching Task Assignment. Proposed algorithm comes with the advantage of generating always feasible population individuals and, thus, eliminating the necessity for a repair step. That is, with respect to other quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms, our proposed QiEA algorithm presents a new way of collapsing the quantum state that integrates the problem constraints in order to avoid later adjusting operations of the system to make it feasible. This results in lower computations and also faster convergence.
